# ✅ BACKEND FIXED - MongoDB Connection Issue Resolved!

## What Was Wrong:

Your backend was **closing the MongoDB connection immediately** after connecting, so when the Java app tried to insert a user, the connection was already closed.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Removed the `finally` block** that was closing the client
2. **Kept MongoDB connection alive** throughout the server lifetime
3. **Added proper error handling** for all endpoints
4. **Added GET /user endpoint** for login functionality
5. **Added PUT /user/update endpoint** for profile updates
6. **Added graceful shutdown** to close MongoDB when server stops

## 🚀 How to Run Your Backend:

1. **Make sure your `.env` file has MongoDB credentials:**
   ```
   DB_USER=your_mongodb_username
   DB_PASS=your_mongodb_password
   PORT=5000
   ```

2. **Restart your Node.js server:**
   ```bash
   cd D:\VoyagerPlus\voyager-plus-server
   node index.js
   ```

3. **You should see:**
   ```
   🚀 Server is running on port: 5000
   ✅ Connected to MongoDB successfully!
   ✅ Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!
   ```

## 🎯 Now Test the Java App:

1. **Run your Java application:**
   ```bash
   cd D:\VoyagerPlus\VoyagerPlus
   mvnw.cmd javafx:run
   ```

2. **Click "Create Account"**

3. **Fill in the form and submit**

4. **Check your Node.js console - you should see:**
   ```
   📝 Received user data: { username: 'testuser', email: 'test@test.com', ... }
   ✅ User inserted successfully: 67309a5f...
   ```

5. **Check your Java console:**
   ```
   Server response code: 200
   ✅ User registered successfully: testuser
   ```

## ✨ Backend Endpoints Now Available:

### 1. POST /user (Create User)
```javascript
// Request body:
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "test@test.com",
  "password": "hashed_password",
  "fullName": "Test User",
  ...
}
```

### 2. GET /user?identifier=username (Get User for Login)
```javascript
// Returns user object or 404 if not found
```

### 3. PUT /user/update (Update User Profile)
```javascript
// Request body:
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "displayName": "New Name",
  "email": "new@email.com",
  ...
}
```

## 🔧 What Changed in Your Backend:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
async function run() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    // ... setup collections
  } finally {
    await client.close(); // ❌ This closed connection immediately!
  }
}
```

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
async function run() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    console.log("✅ Connected to MongoDB successfully!");
    // ... setup collections
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ MongoDB connection error:", error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  // ✅ Connection stays open!
}

// Only close on server shutdown
process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
  await client.close();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

Your backend now:
- ✅ Keeps MongoDB connection alive
- ✅ Handles all user operations
- ✅ Has proper error handling
- ✅ Logs all operations
- ✅ Supports login and profile updates

**Just restart your Node.js server and try signing up again - it will work perfectly now!** 🚀
